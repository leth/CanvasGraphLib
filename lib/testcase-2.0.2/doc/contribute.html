  <h2>Disclamer</h2>
  <p>
    So, you admaire the tool. Make it then even better! Don't like the project? Make it the way you will like it! 8)
    Post your response on the project's home forum at <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/testcase">http://rubyforge.org/projects/testcase</a>
    post any found in the project bugs, post your feature requests. Just post your 'hello there!'. We are all easy going people, so welcome!
  </p>
  
  <h2>How to contribute</h2>
  <p>
    First you'll need to have the freshest source code from svn. If you don't have Subversion on your machine you'll have to install it first.
    Then checkout it froum the projects svn source.
    
    <code class="container">
      svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/testcase/trunk testcase
    </code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then once you've got the changes you wanted, go to the project main directory and create the diff file with the same svn util like that.
    
    <code class="container">
      svn diff > your.diff
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you've got the diff, post it on the project's forum, or simple send it to me at nemshilov-g mail,com
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Simple and plain. And don't forget to test your changes before public them. There are lots of various tests and runners inside
    the test/ directory.
  </p>
  
  <h2>The Coding Convention</h2>
  <p>
    There are nothing special. I just follow the Ruby/Rails coding conventions. Classes/Mixings should be named in the camelized and capitalized
    style. All the methods and attributes, should be downcased and underscored. The indentation is the same, 2 spaces.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The files naming principles are more or less the same.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The only thing I would ask from you is make the things having a predictable interface. So the people would as possible less time
    spend searching your super-interface in the api-documenation.
  </p>
  
  <p>That's all, have fun! 8)</p>
