  <h2>Custom Assertions</h2>
  <p>
    Since the version 2.0 the TestCase library provides the user an ability to define own assertion methods
    which will behave just like any built-in ones. This means that your assertions will be counted
    during the test and your assertions will be processed properly during test-errors handling.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some ways to define your own assertions. The first one and the most natural is
    to define them right in the test-code.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code class="container">
      var Test = TestCase.create({
        assert_something: function() {},
        assert_something_else: function() {},
        
        test_something: function() {
          this.assert_something();
          this.assert_something_else();
        }
      });
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    The main rule here is that your assertion name should start with 'assert'. You can use the camelized
    or underscored style, whatever you use, you'll have camelized/underscored aliaces automatically.
  </p>
  <p>
    The other way to define your own assertions is to extend an existing test-case by calling the
    <code>.extend()</code> class method.<br/>
    <b>NOTE:</b> Don't use your framework Object.extend() functionality for the purpose, it will not work.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code class="container">
      var Test = TestCase.create({....});
      Test.extend({
        assertSomething: function() {}
      });
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    The third way allows you to define custom assertions in run-time. Say in the <code>setUp()</code>
    method call.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code class="container">
      var Test = TestCase.create({
        setup: function() {
          // creating one assertion at once
          this.add_assertion('assert_something', function() {
            // the assertion body
          });
          
          // creating several assertions in a oneshot
          this.add_assertions({
            assert_something_else: function() {
            },
            assert_something_more: function() {
            }
          });
        },
        
        test_something: function() {
          this.assert_something();
          this.assert_something_else();
          this.assert_something_more();
        }
      });
    </code>
  </p>
  
  <h3>Custom assertions filling up</h3>
  <p>
    To make your assertions working you should fill them up with some code which will interact with the system.
    Generally there are two methods for the purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first of them is for handling simple problems which have only a text, 
    just to notify the user that the assertion is failed
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>throw_problem(String problem_text[, String user_message])</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    The second one is for brocken expectations, when you say compare things and need to show the user
    what you expected and what you get. Or for any another cases when you want to show in the error report
    two values, expected and received.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>throw_unexp(mixed expected_value, mixed received_value[, String user_messagep[, boolean format_values]])</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    The last boolean option defines if the error-reporter should create some nice string representations for the given
    values and if possible show the values diff sequence. If it's false or not specified, the expected and received
    values which you put into the method will be converted to strings by the browser rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    An average assertions code might looks like that
  </p>
  <p>
    <code class="container">
      assert_something: function(something, user_message) {
        if (something.wrong()) {
          this.throw_problem('Something wrong', user_message);
        }
      },
      
      assert_something_else: function(something, something_else, user_message) {
        if (something.wrong() && something.state() != something_else.state()) {
          this.throw_unexp(
            'Expected state: '+something.state(),
            something_else.state(),
            user_message
          );
        }
      },
      
      assert_something_more: function(object1, object2, user_message) {
        if (this.some_conditions_happened()) {
          if (object1 !== object2) {
            this.throw_unexp(
              object1, object2, user_message, 
              true // <- the fourth option tells the system to show a nice string representation of the objects
            );
          }
        }
      }
    </code>

    For more help, you can use various internal util methods of the library. Some of them are described in the <a href="api.html">API-Documentation</a>
