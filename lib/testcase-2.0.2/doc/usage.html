  <h2>Terms of usage</h2>
  <p>
    One of the general idea of the project is to provide a test environment which the developers could
    start use right away and follow all their old habits. So we provide a simple API which offers underscored
    and camelised functions which works the same way and in general have well known by another unit-testing systems
    semantics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another main idea of the project is to provide a gui which will not break your existing page layout,
    design, styles etc. So you could run the test right in your pages environment if you like so. For this reason
    we have got this popup test-report system. Therefore you can safely include your unit-tests right into your page
    scripts and run them whenever you like.
  </p>
  <p>
    In additional, since the version 1.0, the reporting system provides some features which allows you
    to skip/activate the cases right on the report popup, and special select-box which allows you to
    filter your cases and display/run only the ones you need.

  <h3>Writing tests</h3>
  <p>
    The library peresents two public classes <code>TestCase</code> and <code>TestSuite</code>. The first one is
    the testing base by itself and the second one is a collector for your tests.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>General Test Example</h4>
    <code class="container">
      var MyTest = TestCase.create({
      
        name: "MyTest", // <- this is an optional test identifier, to see it in the test-results
        
        testFoo: function() {
          this.assertTrue(true);
        },
        
        testBla: function() {
          this.assertFalse(false);
        }
      });
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    And there's another class-method which allows you to extend existing test-cases. <code>.extend()</code>
    <b>NOTE:</b> the method <i>will overwrite</i> methods of your test-case which are already exists.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>TestCase extending.</h4>
    <code class="container">
      var Test = TestCase.create();
      Test.extend({
        testSomething: function() {}
      });
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you've got a test-class, you can run it in several ways. First, each test has the method
    <code>run()</code>, which can be called as a static method or as an instance method.
    <code class="container">
      // like that
      MyTest.run();
      
      // or like that
      var test = new MyTest;
      test.run();
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the version 2.0, there's another test-starting methods <code>runOnLoad()</code> (<code>run_on_load()</code>)
    which will wire your test to be started when the page is loaded.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Run On Load</h4>
    <code class="container">
      var Test = TestCase.create({...});
      Test.runOnLoad();
      
      // or as instance
      var test = new Test();
      test.runOnLoad();
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    The second public class <code>TestSuite</code> is just a container for the test-cases. You can put in a test-suite
    any number of tests you like and when you run the suite it will automatically instance and run all the tests which
    belongs to it.
    <h4>TestSuite example</h4>
    <code class="container">
      var test_suite = new TestSuite(Test1, Test2, Test3...);
      
      // or
      var test_suite = new TestSuite();
      test_suite.add(Test1);
      test_suite.add(Test2, Test3, ...);
      
      // you can remove tests out of the list
      test_suite.remove(Test2);
      
      // to run all the suite test, use the run() method
      test_suite.run();
      
      // or run on load
      test_suite.runOnLoad();
    </code>
  </p>
